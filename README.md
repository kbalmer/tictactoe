# tictactoe

* This repo is my first venture into the world of JavaScript with a few uses of jQuery along the way.

* This version of tic-tact-toe features a reset button, the board is disabled upon a draw/deadlock and the winner is 
announced when a winner... wins.

* The aim of this project was to learn how JavaScript, HTML and CSS interact while also learning the syntax, 
restrictions and possibilities of JavaScript.

* The end goal of learning JavaScript is to eventually dip my toes into TypeScript. I thought I'd learn JavaScript as
a stepping stone towards that.
